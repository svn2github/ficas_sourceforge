This directory contains material to allow FriCAS to be extended
via code written in the programming language Aldor.

The original programs and Makefiles in this directory are due to
Peter Broadbery. Without his initial work and his help I would not have
been able to come so far.

See http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AldorForAxiom and especially
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2008-01/msg00033.html.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation currently is supposed to work as follows:

  git clone https://github.com/hemmecke/fricas-svn.git
  mkdir fricas-build
  cd fricas-build
  ../fricas/configure --enable-aldor --prefix=/path/to/installation/dir
  make
  make install

After that you should be able to call FriCAS and say
  )co somefile.as
and use the content of that file in your FriCAS session.

The interface to Aldor will only be built if 'configure' can find an
aldor executable and certain aldor files.
We require a newer version of aldor, more precisely one that allows
`aldor --print-confvar datadir`.
