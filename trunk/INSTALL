Quick installation:

FriCAS now tries to support standard GNU build/installation 
conventions.  So if you have sources and all prerequisities
just:

configure && make && make install

should work. The above will install FriCAS files in
/usr/local/lib/axiom directory and put axiom command in
/usr/local/bin directory, you can give arguments to configure
to change those locations.

NOTE!! If you use svn (minimal version) the above will install broken
HyperDoc pages -- all graphic examples will be missing (and trying to access
them will crash hypertex).

The get working graphic examples long into X and replace 'make' above by
the following:

make
cd src/paste
make gphts
cd ../..
make

Important: building graphic examples accesses the X server, so it will
not work on text console.  During build drawings will temporarly
appear on the screen.  Redirecting X via ssh should work fine,
but may be slow.

It is also possible to use xvfb-run program, replacing 'make gphts'
above by:

xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 0 1024x768x24" --auto-servernum -n 0 make gphts


--------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisities:

- Lisp, one of:
    * GCL, 2.6.7 or prerelease 2.6.8 
    * sbcl, 1.0.7 or later
    * clisp, 2.41 or later
    * openmcl, 1.1 prerelase 070512
  GCL currently is best tested and fully functional, sbcl and clisp is
  fully functional but graphic support is very new, openmcl and ECL should
  work for core FriCAS (no graphic or HyperDoc).
  Gcl sources are included in full+gcl distribution tarball.

- noweb literate programing tool (http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/).
  Noweb sources are included in full distribution tarball.
  
- X libraries and headers (includig Xpm library).

  On debian (or Ubuntu) you probably need: libx11-dev, libxt-dev, libice-dev,
  libsm-dev, libxau-dev, libxdmcp-dev, libxpm-dev.

- Extra libraries needed by gcl.  If you use Debian gcl you probably
  need libreadline5-dev, libncurses5-dev, libgmp3-dev, libxmu-dev and
  libxaw7-dev.

  On Gentoo system installed gcl probably will not work, one need to
  build own one.

--------------------------------------------------------

Step by step instructions for first time users:

Latest (developement) version of FriCAS is available only
via svn, so you need svn client (see http://subversion.tigris.org/).

0) Change to a directory with enough (1.2 GB) free space

1) Fetch sources:

svn co https://fricas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fricas/trunk fricas

2) Fetch nonstandard prerequisities:

cd fricas
svn co https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements/gcl gcl

mkdir zips

cd zips
wget https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk/axiom/zips/noweb-2.10a.tgz

2a) Go back to first directory
cd ../..

3) Create build directory and change to it:

mkdir ax-build
cd ax-build

4) Configure.  Assuming that you want axiom files to be installed in
/tmp/usr

../fricas/configure --prefix=/tmp/usr

5) Build and install:

make
make install

If you want graphic examples read the note before.

--------------------------------------------------------

Extra information about installation:

The preferred way to build FriCAS is to use already installed
gcl and noweb.  Also, it is preferable to use a separate build
directory.  Assuming that source tree is in fricas subdirectry
and you build in ax-build subdirectry, the following should just
work:

cd ax-build
../fricas/configure && make && make install

If you have istalled gcl in some non-standard place (or you
have multiple installations of gcl and you want to choose
correct one) you can use the following:

cd ax-build
../fricas/configure --with-lisp=/path/to/gcl && make && make install

Alternatively, you can just put gcl sources as a subdirectory
(called gcl) of fricas directory -- in this case the build
process should automatically build gcl and later use the freshly
build gcl.

Currently --with-lisp option accepts other lisp variants, namely
sbcl, clisp, ecl and openmcl.  Build machinery must know which Lisp
variant is in use. gcl, sbcl, clisp and ecl can be autodetected,
for openmcl one has to give an extra argument --with-lisp-flavor=openmcl
(you can also specify flavor for other Lisps, but this argument
is required only for openmcl).  For ecl and openmcl you should also
specify --with-x=no option (otherwise build will hang trying to generate
HyperDoc pages)

Openmcl has a bug in Lisp printer.  This bug causes incorrect printing
of FriCAS types.  To work around the bug you may apply a patch
'contib/omcl.diff' and recompile openmcl (see openmcl documentation
for instructions).
