Quick installation:

FriCAS now tries to support standard GNU build/installation 
conventions.  So if you have sources and all prerequisities
just:

configure && make && make install

should work. The above will install FriCAS files in
/usr/local/lib/axiom directory and put axiom command in
/usr/local/bin directory, you can give arguments to configure
to change those locations.

NOTE!! If you use svn (minimal version) the above will install broken
HyperDoc pages -- all graphic examples will be missing (and trying to access
them will crash hypertex).

The get working graphic examples long into X and replace 'make' above by
the following:

make
cd src/paste
make gphts
cd ../..
make

Important: building graphic examples accesses the X server, so it will
not work on text console.  During build drawings will temporarly
appear on the screen.  Redirecting X via ssh should work fine,
but may be slow.

It is also possible to use xvfb-run program, replacing 'make gphts'
above by:

xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 0 1024x768x24" --auto-servernum -n 0 make gphts


--------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisities:

- Lisp, one of:
    * GCL, 2.6.7 or prerelease 2.6.8 
    * sbcl, 1.0.7 or later
    * clisp, 2.41 or later
    * Closure CL (former openmcl), starting from openmcl 1.1 prerelase
    070512
    * ECL, 0.9j or later
  GCL currently is best tested, but on some platforms there are known
  build problems -- in particular there gcl is incompatible with Fedora
  security enhancements.  All Lisp impementations should give essentially
  the same functionality.  Gcl sources are included in full+gcl distribution
  tarball.

- noweb literate programing tool (http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/).
  Noweb sources are included in full distribution tarball.
  
- X libraries and headers (includig Xpm library).

  On debian (or Ubuntu) you probably need: libx11-dev, libxt-dev, libice-dev,
  libsm-dev, libxau-dev, libxdmcp-dev, libxpm-dev.

- Extra libraries needed by gcl.  If you use Debian gcl you probably
  need libreadline5-dev, libncurses5-dev, libgmp3-dev, libxmu-dev and
  libxaw7-dev.

Known problems:

- On Gentoo system installed gcl probably will not work, one need to
  build own one.

- Gcl is incompatible with Fedora "exec-shield" and strong addess space
  randomization (setting randomize_va_space to 2) -- disabling security
  may help (but one may also hit other problems).

- Boehm garbage collector included in ECL (version 6.8) is incompatible
  with Fedora strong address space randomization (setting randomize_va_space
  to 2).  Using newer version of Boehm garbage collector (7.0 or 7.1)
  should solve this problem.

- Relased version of ECL (0.9j) has serious performance problems.  CVS
  version is much faster.
  
- When doing documentation build (release version contains pre-built
  documentation, so this step is skipped) ECL hangs generating ug13.pht.
  This is annoying, but harmless -- one can just kill the hanged process
  (the hang happens _after_ ug13.pht is generated, in exit function).

- In general, any error when generating documentation will cause build to hang.

- Closure CL (former Openmcl) has a bug in Lisp printer.  This bug causes
  incorrect printing of FriCAS types.  To work around the bug you may apply
  a patch 'contib/omcl.diff' and recompile openmcl (see the patch or openmcl
  documentation for instructions).

--------------------------------------------------------

Step by step instructions for first time users:

Latest (developement) version of FriCAS is available only
via svn, so you need svn client (see http://subversion.tigris.org/).

0) Change to a directory with enough (1.2 GB) free space

1) Fetch sources:

svn co https://fricas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fricas/trunk fricas

2) Fetch nonstandard prerequisities:

cd fricas
svn co https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements/gcl gcl

mkdir zips

cd zips
wget https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk/axiom/zips/noweb-2.10a.tgz

2a) Go back to first directory
cd ../..

3) Create build directory and change to it:

mkdir ax-build
cd ax-build

4) Configure.  Assuming that you want axiom files to be installed in
/tmp/usr

../fricas/configure --prefix=/tmp/usr

5) Build and install:

make
make install

If you want graphic examples read the note before.

--------------------------------------------------------

Extra information about installation:

The preferred way to build FriCAS is to use already installed
gcl and noweb.  Also, it is preferable to use a separate build
directory.  Assuming that source tree is in fricas subdirectry
and you build in ax-build subdirectry, the following should just
work:

cd ax-build
../fricas/configure && make && make install

If you have istalled gcl in some non-standard place (or you
have multiple installations of gcl and you want to choose
correct one) you can use the following:

cd ax-build
../fricas/configure --with-lisp=/path/to/gcl && make && make install

Alternatively, you can just put gcl sources as a subdirectory
(called gcl) of fricas directory -- in this case the build
process should automatically build gcl and later use the freshly
build gcl.

Currently --with-lisp option accepts other lisp variants, namely
sbcl, clisp, ecl and Closure CL (openmcl).  Build machinery must know which Lisp
variant is in use. gcl, sbcl, clisp and ecl can be autodetected,
for Closure CL (openmcl) one has to give an extra argument
--with-lisp-flavor=openmcl (you can also specify flavor for other Lisps,
but this argument is required only for Closure CL (openmcl)).
